# Welcome to New Stars.

<h>Resources</h>
Resources can be spent to <b>improve your empire</b>. You can build colony buildings, expand, trade, build fleets, and more with resources. Just make sure that you don't go bankrupt!

<h>Worlds</h>
You can <b>colonize worlds</b> to create a colony there. This can be done with a colonist unit>.

<h>Colonies</h>
Buildings house jobs. Jobs produce <b>monthly resources</b>. Jobs are worked by colony population. Enough food and housing are required for population to grow. Amenities help keep population productive.

<h>Expansion</h>
Use builders to <b>build starbases</b> in new systems, and expand your empire. If your empire runs out of room, you could use force.

<h>Combat</h>
Another way of expanding your empire. Combine ships into fleets and take over other starbases. Watch out for barbaric clans, as they are hostile to all empires. May the best win!

<h>Starbases</h>
Starbases are bases at a claimed system. They can be specialized (designated) to do different tasks, and are useful for defence.

<h>Diplomacy</h>
You can trade resources, form alliances, negotiate peace, and more with empire trade. It's generally easier to trade with more cooperative governments.

<lore>There is much more to New Stars, and this was an oversimplified starter guide.</lore>
