## Changed

### Tweaks
- **Special resources are more equally distributed across the map.**
    - Void worlds now generate much more often, as antimatter was extremely rare.
    - Class O stars have a higher chance to spawn.
- **Most base resources have been increased from +5, to +10 per month.**
    - Momentum at the start of the game is now faster, as it took a while to get started previously.
- **Peaceful clans now have one agenda.**
    - This is so you can now meet conditions for open-borders with peaceful clans.
- **Colonists now take 180 days to build, instead of 60.**
    - Unless you are on the fastest game speed.
- **Game duration now affects logistical pacing.**
    - Time to build fleets or colony buildings is scaled based on duration.
    - Resource costs are not currently affected, although this may change.
    - Exploration is constant on all speeds.
- **Starter colonies, regardless of origin, start with an additional food building and 2 population.**
    - Like in Civilization, colony starvation is localized to the colony.
    - This means that if a colony has a food deficit it will slowly lose population.
    - The extra population ensures that food is produced immediately.
- **Each population uses 0.25 food instead of 1 food.**
    - This means each food building job supports 4 population.

## Fixed
- Crashing bugs with AI military performing weird shenanigans.
- Game lacked special abilities or unique playstyles (i.e. all governments were too similar).
- Colony building is unbalanced (numbers need tweaking).
- Fleets go hidden in wormhole systems.
- Star system simulation have some graphical issues (lighting, star graphical artifacts etc.) 
- Monthly updates are laggy and unoptimized, especially with AI.
- Simulated combat is inconsistent, and buggy.
- Seamless claims now fill correctly.
- **and hundreds more random bugs...**
